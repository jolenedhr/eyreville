This is a site made by Jolene Smith purely for experimentation and demonstration using __Wax__ is a [tool](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/#/wax/) for generating static sites for digital humanities using principles of Minimal Computing..

The collection items are taken from my colleagues at DHR, but much of the attribute data is invented for the demo.
